This is a list of some of my favourite quotes.

“The day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect, he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise.” 
<b>Alden Nowlan</b>

"The great lovers will always be unhappy, because for them love is great and so they ask of their beloved the same intensity of thought that they have for her - otherwise they feel betrayed."
<b>Cesare Pavese</b>

"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win, because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle.”
<b>Miguel de Unamuno</b>

"The important thing in life is not to triumph but to compete.” 
<b>Pierre de Coubertin</b>

"We need to change the way we feel — to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something, or to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs."

"It has been said that families who are closely attached may cut themselves off from the outside world. So it was with the Romanovs."

"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better." 
<b>Samuel Beckett</b>
