Ono, Mato, and Poeia
======

“What a yawn, Mato!”, screamed suddenly Ono.
“It’s still rumbling!”, followed Poeia astonished.
“Yaaawn!”, croaked Mato again. 

Clap, clap, and clap again,
slammed Ono with extreme enthusiasm.
“Don’t snuff now!”, whipped Poeia excited.

-Smack, smack-

Poeia slapped Mato with her lips.
Ono sobbed behind the scenes.

Mato screeches.
Poeia sighs.
Ono tweets.

Silence.

Then, a tick. -Tick. Tick. Tick.-

This is the moment when the tension rises, everybody is waiting for something to happen, a -knock, knock-, or a -growl, growl- , people chewing, a creak, a crash, or even a splash, but instead





a thump. 





A thump again. 

Ono, Mato and Poeia are they now waiting for something to happen.

And a bang,
-Baaang!-
then a clang,
-Claaang!-
and a howl,
-Hooowl!- 

It was Poeia!
Then, scratches to Mato
-scratch, scratch-
Mato stops it
-rip, rip- 

And… break!

Poeia dashes whatever she finds around her:
flowers,
rocks,
Ono.

Space!

Ono clucks as dashed towards Mato.
But he impacts the wall instead, and CRACK!
The wall is falling down now. 

- sigh - 
- sigh -
- sigh - 

Ignoring the situation, Mato jumps on Poeia.
-Whoop!-
Poeia attacks Mato.
-Squirt!-
Mato bites Poeia and, 
-Crunch!- 
Poeia: -Hoooonk!-
Mato: -Roooooar!-

With wizardry Poeia pecks Mato and escapes. 
She is safe now.

-Riiing, Riiing- 

It’s a phone. 
It’s Ono.
It’s 3am. 

Ono left and went far away.
He is looking for other yawns somewhere else now,
because he had enough of bangs and clangs there.
He learned how to slam now.

Poeia and Mato keep squeaking to each other,
in an eternal chase, in this vast space.



Space.



And a door slams. 

- Slam! - 

What a slam!

- The Slam -
